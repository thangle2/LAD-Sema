# LAD-Sema

These are the codes that I have written for Sema Quadir while working as an undergraduate researcher in the Laboratory of Addictive Disorders. Many codes that we use on a daily basis were not shown as they are old version of Sema.m that I changed throughout the year to fit different experiments. With DRL.m, my first big project, my code was used to explore additional parameters in an operant DRL task. Sema gave me a paper that used a similar DRL task but reported additional measures such as burst responses and modified efficiency. Based on this paper, I figured out how to calculate and extract data from our operant files and wrote a code so that Sema could analyze Burst Responses, Modified Efficiency, Peak Rate and Peak Time. With Go-No-Go, I learned a new coding language (MED-PC)/ In this task, I modified all the inputs and outputs to make the collaborator's code compatible with our boxes, thus setting up a new behavioral paradigm in the lab.
