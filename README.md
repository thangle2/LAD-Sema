# LAD-Sema

These are the codes that I have written for Sema Quadir while working as an undergraduate researcher in the Laboratory of Addictive Disorders. Many codes that we used daily were not shown as these were older versions of Sema.m that were changed throughout the time I was at the lab. They were altered to fit different experiments that developed with each sequential experiment. With DRL.m, my first big project, my code was used to explore additional parameters in an operant DRL task. Sema gave me a paper that used a similar DRL task but reported additional measures, such as burst responses and modified efficiency, we needed to add. Based on this paper, I employed calculations and extraction of data from our operant files in a new code allowing Sema to analyze Burst Responses, Modified Efficiency, Peak Rate, and Peak Time in addition to the original parameters. With Go-No-Go, I learned a new coding language (MED-PC). In this task, I modified all the inputs and outputs to make the collaborator's code compatible with our operant boxes, thus setting up a new behavioral paradigm in the lab.
