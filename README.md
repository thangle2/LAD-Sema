# LAD-Sema

These are the code that I have written for Sema Quadir while working as a student researcher in the Laboratory of Acohol Disorder. A lot of the codes that we use on a daily basis were not shown as they are old version of Sema.m that I changed throughout the year to fit different experiment. DRL.m was the first big project that Sema Quadir given me to extract certain data from the excel file and figure out the Burstresponses,Efficiency ,Modified Efficieny , peakrate, peaktime that I figured out how to calculate after reading and analyzing a sciencetific paper that Sema showed me. Go-no-go was an indepdent project that was bestowed upon me to learn a new coding language, MED-PC, and write a workable code to run a behavioral experiments with the rats.
